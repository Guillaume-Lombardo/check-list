# Recognizing Code Review Contributions

* Acknowledge team members who frequently participate in reviews during team meetings.
* Provide small incentives (e.g., team shoutouts or croissants) for consistent code review participation.
* Create a "Reviewer of the Month" award to recognize valuable feedback.
* Include code review efforts in performance reviews and promotion criteria. (for our managers)
