# Code Review Conflict Resolution

* Step 1: The reviewer and author should first attempt to resolve conflicts through discussion in the PR/MR comments.
* Step 2: If unresolved, the issue should be escalated to the team lead, who will act as a mediator.
* Step 3: In cases of technical disagreements, the team may consult an expert in the relevant area or refer to the project's architecture documentation.
* Step 4: Final decisions should be documented in the PR/MR for future reference.
