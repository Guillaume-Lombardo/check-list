# Time Allocation for Code Reviews

- Every developer is expected to allocate at least 2 hours per day for code reviews.
- Daily stand-ups should include a reminder for developers to prioritize code reviews.
- Reviews must be completed within 48 hours of the PR/MR submission to avoid delays in the development pipeline.
- In cases of urgent reviews (e.g., blocking a critical release), the team lead may request priority handling.
