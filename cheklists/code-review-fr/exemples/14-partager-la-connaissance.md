# Involving Team Members in Code Reviews

* Rotate reviewers so that each team member reviews different parts of the codebase over time.
* Pair junior developers with experienced reviewers for mentorship opportunities.
* Host "Review Debriefs" after major releases where the team discusses lessons learned from the review process.
* Encourage team members to comment on PR/MRs even if they are not assigned reviewers, fostering broader knowledge sharing.
