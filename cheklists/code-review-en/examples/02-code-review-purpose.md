# Purpose of Code Reviews

* The primary goal is to improve code quality and maintain project consistency.
* Code reviews help:
  * Catch bugs and potential issues before they reach production.
  * Ensure adherence to the team's coding standards.
  * Share knowledge across the team to prevent silos.
  * Encourage team collaboration and mentorship.
* Code reviews should never be used as a means for personal critique but as a constructive exercise focused on the code itself.
