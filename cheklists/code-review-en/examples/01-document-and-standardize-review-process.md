# Code Review Process Standardization

- Every pull/merge request (PR/MR) must have a minimum of two reviewers.
- PRs/MRs must include a link to the issue it addresses.
- PRs/MRs must pass automated tests before being reviewed.
- Code reviews must include checks for:
  - Code style consistency (following our style guide).
  - Security vulnerabilities.
  - Performance considerations.
  - Testing coverage (unit tests, integration tests).
- Reviewers should provide feedback within 48 hours of the PR/MR submission.
- The author of the PR/MR must address all comments before merging.
- Once all feedback is addressed, the team lead must approve the merge.
