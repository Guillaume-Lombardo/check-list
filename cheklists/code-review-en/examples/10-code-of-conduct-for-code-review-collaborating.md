# Encouraging a Collaborative Code Review Environment

* Encourage developers to share their knowledge through **constructive** feedback.
* Set up a "Review Buddy" system where _less experienced developers_ are paired with _senior reviewers_ to learn from the process.
* Host weekly "Code Review Clinics" where the team discusses challenging reviews and shares solutions.
* Create a **"No Blame" culture** where mistakes are treated as learning opportunities.
