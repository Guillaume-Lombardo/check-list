# Code Review Turnaround Guidelines

- Code reviews should be completed within 24-48 hours of a pull/merge request submission.
- Urgent or critical PR/MRs should be reviewed within 12 hours.
- If a reviewer is unable to complete the review within the set time frame, they must notify the team lead to reassign the review.
- Developers are responsible for following up on their PR/MRs if no feedback is received within the given timeframe.
