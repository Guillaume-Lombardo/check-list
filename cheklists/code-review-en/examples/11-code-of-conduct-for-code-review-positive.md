# Fostering a Positive Code Review Culture

* Feedback should be objective and focus on the code, not the individual.
* Use phrases like "Consider trying…" or "I noticed that…" instead of making demands.
* Provide positive feedback when the author implements a creative or effective solution.
* Avoid personal language and focus on the impact of the changes.
* If disagreements arise, frame them as discussions about the best solution rather than debates.
