# Prioritizing Critical Code Reviews

- Major release PR/MRs should be marked with the "[Major Release]" tag in the PR/MR title.
- Critical code areas, such as security patches or changes to core modules, should be flagged with "High Priority".
- Senior developers should be assigned to review critical PR/MRs to ensure thorough scrutiny.
- Allocate extra review time for critical sections of the codebase, allowing for deeper analysis and potential pair programming sessions.
