# Optimizing CI Automation for Code Reviews

* Ensure that linters, formatters, and static analysis tools are well-configured to minimize false positives.
* Include only necessary checks in the CI pipeline to avoid overloading developers with irrelevant warnings.
* Use Jenkins  for automated tests and ensure that tests fail only for legitimate issues.
* Regularly update the rules for Jenkins (white wish) to reflect the evolving codebase and development standards.
