# Team-Oriented Code Review Practices

* Remind reviewers that the goal is to improve the code, not criticize the author.
* Frame suggestions as opportunities for collaboration, using phrases like "How about we…?" or "Could we consider…?".
* Include multiple reviewers on larger PR/MRs to get diverse perspectives and ensure a well-rounded review.
* Celebrate successful reviews by acknowledging contributions from both authors **and** reviewers.
