# Code Review Best Practices

## 1. Team Wide Practices (once per project)

- [ ] Document and standardize the code review process. ([example](examples/01-document-and-standardize-review-process.md))
- [ ] Ensure that the purpose of code reviews is clear to everyone. ([example](examples/02-code-review-purpose.md))
- [ ] Ensure that "Definition of Done" is documented and clear to everyone. ([example](examples/03-document-of-done.md))
- [ ] Provide developers time to participate in code reviews. ([example](examples/04-time-allocation.md))
- [ ] Define a process for conflict resolution in code reviews. ([example](examples/05-conflict-resolution.md))
- [ ] Have a definitive style guide for style preferences. ([example](examples/06-coding-style.md))
- [ ] Use static/dynamic analysis to reduce noise during reviews (linting, diffing, etc.). ([example](examples/07-analysis-in-code-review.md))
- [ ] Set clear expectations for code review turnaround times. ([example](examples/08-turnaround-guideline.md))
- [ ] Highlight major releases or significant code areas so that it is a priority in reviews. ([example](examples/09-prioritization-major-code-review.md))
- [ ] Create an open, supportive environment for code sharing and learning. ([example](examples/10-code-of-conduct-for-code-review-collaborating.md)
- [ ] Encourage a healthy review process where no one feels judged. ([example](examples/11-code-of-conduct-for-code-review-positive.md))
- [ ] Reward contributions to code reviews as much as other forms of contribution. ([example](examples/12-code-of-conduct-for-code-review-recognition.md))
- [ ] Have a good balance of automation in CI with minimal false positives. ([example](examples/13-CI-optimization.md))
- [ ] Make sure to involve team members in code reviews to spread knowledge. ([example](examples/14-share-the-knowledge.md))
- [ ] Encourage reviews to be a team exercise, not a personal attack. ([example](examples/15-team-oriented-code-review-pratice.md))

## 2. During Development (Author)

- [ ] Follow the coding standards and any other team guidelines.
- [ ] Stay consistent with the overall project design and architecture.
- [ ] Write a failing test if the change is for a bug fix.
- [ ] Break down complex tasks into smaller, easily manageable PR/MRs.
- [ ] Consider the impact of the change on other parts of the system.
- [ ] Take notes on any questions or concerns about the change to discuss them during the review.
- [ ] Write automated tests.
- [ ] Write the documentation for the feature or change if required.
- [ ] Update any documentation that may have been affected through the changes.

## 3. After the Development (Author)

- [ ] Review your code before submitting for review.
- [ ] Ensure that the changes are complete and ready for review, including all necessary tests and documentation.
- [ ] Verify that the code change has been properly tested in a development environment.
- [ ] Double-check that the code adheres to the project’s coding standards and best practices.
- [ ] Identify any potential performance, security, or scalability concerns and note them for discussion during the review.
- [ ] Make lists and tag proper files (e.g., third-party files, autogenerated files) to avoid confusion in the PR/MR.
- [ ] Approach the review process with an open mind and be willing to learn from and collaborate with other team members.

## 4. Before the Review (Reviewer)

- [ ] Understand the requirement and the context in which the change was made.
- [ ] Based on the requirements, prepare a list of items that should have been covered in the changes.
- [ ] Perform an exploration of the application to detect edge cases.
- [ ] Consider the author's viewpoint and the reasons behind the change.
- [ ] Make a list of any potential risks or issues and ask about possible mitigations.
- [ ] Provide clear and actionable feedback, including specific suggestions for improvement and exploration of any concerns.
- [ ] Identify any potential performance, security, or scalability concerns, and discuss them with the author.
- [ ] Prioritize your feedback, focusing on the most important issues first.
- [ ] Review any tests included with the code changes to verify that they adequately cover the functionality and edge cases.
- [ ] Ensure that the code change adheres to the project’s coding standards and best practices.
- [ ] Ensure that the relevant documentation has been updated.
- [ ] Work alongside the decision authority when verifying changes against the release of personal preference.
- [ ] Provide comments to suggest improvements, but prefix it with "Nit:" if it's not critical to meeting the standards.
- [ ] See short-term and long-term considerations in mind.
- [ ] Consider using pair programming as an alternative or supplement to code reviews.
- [ ] Provide positive feedback in addition to constructive criticism, to reinforce good practices and boost team morale.

## 5. After the Code Review (Author)

- [ ] Address all the feedback received, including any comments or questions raised.
- [ ] Implement the suggested changes and provide explanations where needed.
- [ ] Run the tests and ensure that they all pass after making changes.
- [ ] Update any documentation or code comments affected by the changes.
- [ ] Seek feedback from other team members if you are unsure about the changes.
- [ ] Submit the updated code for a fresh round of review if needed.

## 6. After the Code Review (Reviewer)

- [ ] Resolve conflicting opinions in a timely manner; be it a PR/MR is about done due to disagreement.
- [ ] Verify that all the feedback has been addressed by the author.
- [ ] Review the updated code and ensure that the suggested changes have been implemented as expected.
- [ ] Be responsive and ensure the review trail stays on pace.
- [ ] Be open to feedback from the author and be willing to make adjustments to your feedback if necessary.

## 7. After Approval (Author / Reviewer)

- [ ] Merge the approved code changes into the main/release branch.
- [ ] Verify that the code change is functioning as expected in the production environment.
- [ ] Celebrate the successful completion of the code-change!
