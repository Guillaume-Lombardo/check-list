# checklists

this checklist are heavily based on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)

this is aimed to help smoothing relations and workflow to make it more efficient and comfortable for every one.

(use `clear && tree . &&  find . -type f -exec echo "Filename: {}" \; -exec cat {} \; -exec echo "" \;` to display structure and file content in console output.)
